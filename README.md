# ðŸ¤– Automated Meeting Transcript & MOM Generator

This project is a full-stack web application designed to automate the process of creating Minutes of Meeting (MOM). It takes a video or audio recording of a meeting, generates a full transcript, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a structured, editable summary with key discussions, decisions, and action items.
